## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    cd spam-classifier-app
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application should now be running in a new tab in your web browser!
